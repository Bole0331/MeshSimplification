- Bole Chen (bolec@andrew.cmu.edu)
- Haixin Liu (haixinl@andrew.cmu.edu)

## [Proposal](./index)

## Updated Schedule

## Works completed so far
- Designed and implemented a new mesh simplification algorithm to make it easy to parallelize.
- Discussed with professor Todd Mowry about how to parallelize this mesh simplification algorithm.
- Find potential parallel parts in the serial version algorithm, and parallized those parts with OpenMP and PThread.
- Designed the new parallel version algorithm. Trying to parallize our new mesh simplification algorithm in a multiple task queue model.

## preliminary results

## Current Issues

## First try to parallelism

## Way to final parallelism
