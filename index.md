## Summary

<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Surface mesh simplification is the process of reducing the number of faces used in a surface mesh while keeping the overall shape, volume and boundaries preserved as much as possible. There are lots of mesh simplification algorithms, and all of them are iterative, greedy algorithms that might cost really long time. For this project we will implement two of the mesh simplification algorithms "Quadric Error Metrics" and "Simple, Fast, and Effective Polygon Reduction Algorithm". We see some spaces for both the algorithms to speedup in parallel. So we will parallelize these two algorithms with Cuda and OpenMP to see how much speedup we can gain.</p>
