## Summary

<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;Surface mesh simplification is the process of reducing the number of faces used in a surface mesh while keeping the overall shape, volume and boundaries preserved as much as possible. There are lots of mesh simplification algorithms, and all of them are iterative, greedy algorithms that might cost really long time. For this project we will implement two of the mesh simplification algorithms "Quadric Error Metrics" and "Simple, Fast, and Effective Polygon Reduction Algorithm". We see some spaces for both the algorithms to speedup in parallel. So we will parallelize these two algorithms with Cuda and OpenMP to see how much speedup we can gain.</p> 

## Background

## The challenge

## Resources

- Languages: We will use C++, Cuda and OpenMP library for this Project. 
- Code Base: There is no start code for us, we will build the whole project on our own.
- Platforms: We will run our project on Mac Pro Laptop, Xeon Phi and Latedays Cluster.

## Goals and Deliverables

<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;Our minimum goal for this project is to implement the parallel version mesh simplification algorithm with Cuda and OpenMP. Right now for a object that consists with millions of patches, it takes really a long time to run the serial version mesh simplification algorithm, which is intolerable. Hence for our parallel version implementationm, we want to show in the poster session that it can finish in seconds.</p>

<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;We will implement two different mesh simplification algorithms and parallelize them with Cuda and OpenMP. So we will compare the performance of differnt combinations. The problems itself is a graphic problem, so we believe Cuda could be a ideal fit for this mesh simplification problem. We will do a lot of experiments and analyses work to compare these two parallel model to understand deeply why one performs better than the other one. </p>
